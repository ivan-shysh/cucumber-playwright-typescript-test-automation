What is `pickle` in Cucumber?

In the context of Cucumber and other behavior-driven development (BDD) frameworks, "pickle" refers to a compiled version of the scenarios written in Gherkin syntax. When you write scenarios in a .feature file using Gherkin, they are human-readable descriptions of software behaviors. These scenarios then need to be executed as tests. The process involves translating or compiling these Gherkin scenarios into a form that the testing framework can understand and executeâ€”these compiled objects are known as "pickles."

Key Points About Pickles:
Compilation: The act of transforming Gherkin scenarios into pickles is essentially a compilation step in the test execution process. This step is handled internally by the Cucumber framework.
Execution: Pickles are what Cucumber actually executes. Each pickle represents a scenario or an example from a Scenario Outline in the .feature file, including the steps and any example data.
Isolation: The concept of pickles allows Cucumber to execute each scenario in isolation. It ensures that the test suite can run scenarios in any order or even in parallel, as each pickle contains all the information needed for execution.
Details: A pickle includes the scenario's steps and any data from Examples in Scenario Outlines. This data is then used by the step definitions to run tests.
